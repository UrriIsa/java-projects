# Deletreo (Spelling Game)



`Deletreo` is an interactive Java game where players try to spell words correctly in various difficulty modes, earning points according to their performance. The program includes the functionality to save and retrieve historical scores through serialization, in addition to taking into account the time of writing and letter hits. It was done in my first semester.
